Pandas homework for Data Science Bootcamp


Observed Trends:

 - All 5 of the top performing schools were charter schools while all five of the bottom performing schools were district schools. Within the bottom five performing schools, there is a consistently low percentage of students passing math. None of the schools had a math passing rate higher than 70%. Meanwhile, within the top performing schools, each school showed at least 90% of students passing either reading, math, or both.
 
 -Passing rates and average scores both decreased as school spending increased. A similar negative relationship can be found between test scores and school size, i.e. scores decreased as schools sizes increased.
 
-More than 80% of district students are passing reading but only about 53% are passing both reading and math. Given that about 67% percent of district students are passing math, it seems there is a large population of students who are only passing a single subject.
